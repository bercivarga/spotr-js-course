# Week 2 assignment

For this week's assignment, you need to combine the first two workshops' learnings, and create a repository that contains your first ever 90's themed website! How exciting! ðŸ•º

Your tasks are the following:
- Navigate to your documents folder, and create a new folder on your computer, using the terminal **ONLY**
- Initialize a `git` repository in that project's folder
- Create an remote repository on GitHub
- Connect your local repository to the remote repo
- Try to create one of [these](https://www.adamhammond.com/ugly-90s-webpages/) websites
  - All of these sites are straightforward to implement, don't be intimidated by the amount of things on the screen
  - Don't forget that you can copy stuff
  - You can deviate from the design, the end goal if to have an ugly 90's themed site. Go crazy!
  - You **NEED** to have one transition, one media query, and one animation on the page (remember: `transition` property, `@media` and `@keyframes` at-rule)
  - The original pages aren't responsive. Ours need to be. Use `@media` queries!
- Try to commit as much as you can, your repository needs to have at least 10 commits besides the initial commit
- Create at least two branches
- Rename at least one commit
- When you finished with the project, merge all your changes to `main` and delete all unused branches

You need to do all of these tasks in order to pass this assignment. If you're finished, send me a link to your (public) GitHub repository where you host the remote of your project. I'll clone it and leave feedback either on Slack.

Happy hacking! ðŸ¦§
