# Week 2 - Advanced HTML & CSS, Terminal, and Git

This week we're diving deeper into the world of CSS, and we're going to start using our terminal alongside git.

This week we’ll be covering the following topics:
- Advanced HTML and CSS
  - Last time we skipped some HTML tags that might be useful for you in the future, so we’ll be covering those.
  - We haven’t touched on responsive design with CSS yet. This week we’ll learn how to make our websites look good on any screen.
  - We’ll cover CSS transitions and animations, and the difference between the two concepts.
  - We’ll live-code an ugly 90's styled site in class that covers what we’ve learned so far. This’ll also be your assignment for next week.
- Intro to the bash shell and the terminal
  - We’ll learn how to navigate the file system by only using the terminal.
  - We’ll create and delete files and directories
  - We’ll cover a bunch of other commands that you may find useful on your programming journey
- Intro to git
  - We’ll learn what git is and how to configure it on your computer
  - We’ll learn how to initialise a git repository
  - We’ll create a remote repository on GitHub
  - We’ll learn the basics of git for managing our projects
  - We’ll cover how to make pull requests
