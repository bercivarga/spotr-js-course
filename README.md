# Berci's zero-to-hero front-end workshops

Hi there! If you're reading this, then you are most likely someone who is interested in learning about front-end web technologies.

You're at the right place! I prepared this workshop per request of the front-end chapter in order to provide a good basis for learning modern front-end web development with JavaScript, and eventually React.

In this course, we'll cover:
- Introduction to front-end development with JavaScript
- Fast-track HTML and CSS course
- Introduction to the command line and version control systems
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Intermediate JavaScript
- Building an app with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- Advanced command line and git usage
- Building and tooling front-end applications
- Complete introduction to React
- Intermediate React
- CSS frameworks
- Introduction TypeScript
- TypeScript in React
- Testing
- SSR with Next.js
- ...and more! (suggestions welcome)

We'll be discussing the topics above in group-based workshops, held every Thursday between 3-6PM.

See you in class! üë®‚Äçüè´
