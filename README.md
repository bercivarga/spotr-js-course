# Week 3 - Pull requests and git workflows

This week we’ll be rounding up our journey with git and we’ll learn how to create pull requests, a basic git workflow, and an in-class exercise for practicing the usage of git in a team project setting.

This is going to be the last non-JavaScript related workshop, so if you’ve had any questions lined up so far regarding the content covered up until this point then this is the time to ask them.

See y'all in class!
