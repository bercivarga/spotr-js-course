# Berci's Spotr front-end workshops

Hi there! If you're reading this, then you are most likely someone who is interested in learning about front-end web technologies.

You're at the right place! I prepared this workshop per request of the front-end chapter in order to share some tips from my journey of learning modern front-end web development with JavaScript.

This course starts from the fundamentals, and sets its goal to cover all the relevant technologies we currently use in our applications.

Throughout the next months, we'll be covering the following topics:
- Introduction to front-end development with JavaScript
- Fast-track HTML and CSS course
- Introduction to the command line and version control systems
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Intermediate JavaScript
- Building an app with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- Advanced command line and git usage
- Building and tooling front-end applications
- Complete introduction to React
- Intermediate React
- CSS frameworks
- Introduction TypeScript
- TypeScript in React
- Testing
- SSR with Next.js
- ...and more! (suggestions welcome)

We'll be discussing the topics above in group-based workshops, held every Thursday between 3-6PM (times may vary).

See you in class! üë®‚Äçüè´
